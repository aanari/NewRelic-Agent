**Parameters**

- - `license_key`

    A valid NewRelic license key for your account.

    This value is also automatically sourced from the `NEWRELIC_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable.

- - `app_name`

    The name of your application.

    This value is also automatically sourced from the `NEWRELIC_APP_NAME` environment variable.

- - `path_rules`

    A HashRef containing path replacement rules, containing case-insensitive regex patterns as string keys, and evaluatable strings as replacement values.

    Regex capturing groups work as intended, so you can specify something like this in your ruleset:

        # Replaces '/pages/new/asdf' with '/pages/new'
        '(\/pages\/new)\/\S+' => '$1'
